description: Functional Programming as a programming paradigm has  been ridiculed for its "simplistic" and "academic" nature. In 1989, John Hughes published <i>Why Functional Programming Matters</i>, detailing the features of Functional Programming that allowed authors to write cleaner and shorter code. In this paper, I analyze what made Hughes' writing as compelling as it was. It can be found <a href="../AWDPortfolio/assets/Why-FP-Matters.pdf">here</a>.
