description: This was a rough draft of the reference document project. Of note are the graphics -- they were produced as I was writing the rough draft. I noticed that in most computer science reference documents/how-tos, there were oodles of instructions on how to do stuff, but images would have helped almost all of th em convey their message better. The hand drawn circles where there initially, but thanks to feedback from Lande, I added some more visual elements, such as arrows.
