description: This was the initial feedback I got from Isabella. In it, she pointed out that the title was maybe a little too grandiose, and a title that simply gets to the point would do a more servicable job for the blog post. She also pointed out that the external factors of having a "Quick-Start Guide," a holdover of the website template I was using, could confuse the reader. It can be found <a href="../AWDPortfolio/assets/IsabellaRevision.pdf">here</a>
